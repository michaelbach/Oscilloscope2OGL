Oscilloscope2OGL
================

A simple multi-channel "oscilloscope" for MacOS. Similar to Oscilloscope3, but using OpenGL; with a simplified tester.


This oscilloscope can have one or up to kOscilloscopeMaxNumberOfTraces traces (preset to 8).
Most calls are availabe in both single- and multichannel mode.
 
The oscilloscope advances 1 point in device space per call (advanceWithSample(s))

Entire sweeps can also be displayed with setTrace:toSweep: / setSingleTraceToSweep:

0 is in the vertical center, the vertical scaling is addressed by calling setMaxPositiveValue:.
